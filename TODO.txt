// Things to do
x Make deck and card list background alternate colors between white and grey to make look better
- Implement grade system for decks
- Create list view for grades
- Make landscape version of the activities so far

// Bug fixes

x Need to make it where only a few words of the question are displayed in the edit card table and to
eliminate unnecessary line breaks so questions are not spread apart in the table
x If user tries to edit deck that has not had a card inserted into it yet, it should display a
"No cards in deck" instead of being blank
- If user tries to see grades for a deck they haven't tried yet, it should display a
 "No grade for this deck yet" instead of being blank
- For some reason, text size on nexus 6 is really big in deck and card list, don't know if its just
an emulator error or not


// Testing
- Test layouts for all screen sizes for all activities
